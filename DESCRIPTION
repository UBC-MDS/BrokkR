Description: This package allows users to provide a list of URLs for webpages of interest and creates a dataframe with Bag of Words representation that can then later be fed into a machine learning model of their choice. Users also have the option to produce a dataframe with just the raw text of their target webpages to apply the text representation of their choice instead.
