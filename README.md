# BrokkR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package allows users to provide a list of URLs for webpages of
interest and creates a dataframe with Bag of Words representation that
can then later be fed into a machine learning model of their choice.
Users also have the option to produce a dataframe with just the raw text
of their target webpages to apply the text representation of their
choice instead.

## Why `BrokkR`

There are some libraries and packages that can facilitate this job, from
scraping text from a URL to returning it to a bag of words (BOW).
However, to the extent of our knowledge, there is no sufficiently handy
and straightforward package for this purpose. This package is a tailored
combination of `Rvest` and `CountVectorizer`.
[`Rvest`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rvest/versions/1.0.3)
widely used to pull different sources of data from HTML and XML pages,
and
[`CountVectorizer`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/superml/versions/0.4.0/topics/CountVectorizer)
is a well-known package to convert a collection of texts to a matrix of
token counts.

## Features

The BrokkR package includes the following four functions:

-   `create_id()`: Takes a character vector of webpage urls as an input
    and returns a character vector of unique identifiers for each
    webpage based on their url. The identifier is composed of the main
    webpage name and if multiple urls share the same parent webpage
    name, then the sequential ids are appended by a number.
-   `brok_scrape()` : Takes a character vector of urls and using Rvest
    extracts the raw text from each and creates a list as an output.
    Polite was used to avoid being flagged as malicious during the
    scraping process.
-   `duster()`: Takes a character vector of urls and uses the above two
    functions to create a tibble with the webpage identifiers, the raw
    url, and the raw text from the webpage with extra line breaks
    removed as columns.
-   `bow()`: Takes a tibble as an input and returns the tibble with bag
    of words represenation appended.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BrokkR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/BrokkR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/BrokkR")
```

## Example

To see a detailed example of the usage of this package, please see the
vignette called ‚ÄúExample Usage‚Äù under the Articles Tab.

``` r
library(BrokkR)

urls <- c('https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/jobs/energy-engineer-1.html', 'https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/jobs/materials-engineer-24.html')

#if you want the raw text only
df_bow <- duster(urls)
#> Test passed ü•á
#> Test passed üéâ

#if you want bag of words representation
#df_bow <- duster(urls) |> bow()
```
